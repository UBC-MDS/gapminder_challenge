# Project Proposal

## Motivation and Purpose

Our Role: NGO

Target Audience: Students, General Public Interested in Development

This project is designed to augment the gapminder [worldview upgrader](https://upgrader.gapminder.org/) tool that MDS students were introduced to at the beginning of the program. [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) is an NGO founded to address systematic misconceptions about global development. Gapminder provides free-to-access data and teaching material on global development based on reliable statistics. Their worldview upgrader involves participants answering questions about various topics linked to UN development goals, and being provided correct answers with accompanying explanations. This project proposes to augment the experience of the worldview upgrader by providing interactive visualizations along with answers to questions related to UN development goals, leveraging the Gapminder dataset. This allows users to explore and manipulate the data supporting the answers to the questions, allowing for a dynamic and enriched learning experience.
